Usage: net [options]
  
  This program funtions as a multithreaded database where clients
    can request searches through CSV files and preform operations
    while other clients are connected.

  On the client side the order of the operations is as follows:

    load->build->search->destroy->unload

  Once a tree has been built other trees can also be built and searched.
  Multiple searches can happen on the same tree or different trees simultaneously.
  Only one file can be loaded in at a time. To load in the a new file the
  current one must first be unloaded. 


  To host the server:
  
    ./net -s    The program will then wait for any incoming connections. 


 
  To run as the client:
 
    ./net -c[other options] This will send a request to the running server.

 
  As the client the request types are:

    -S [Request]  Send a search request to the server
 
      Search requests must be formated as follows:
        
               <FieldName>=<Value> 
       
      Currently the only valid fieldnames are Year, "Data Value", and State.
      Example: ./net -cS State=HI 
     
    -l <FileName> Request for the server to load the specified file

      The only valid files at the moment are: 'drugs.csv' and 'air_quality.csv'
      Example: ./net -cl drugs.csv
    
    -b [Field]    Makes the server build a searchable tree based on the field given

      The build funtion works for both files however the build time of the
      fields in air_quality is large so at the moment only the following fields 
      are valid:

        Year, "Data Value", and State
      Example: ./net -cb Year

    -d [Field]    Makes the server remove a searchable tree based on the field given

      The destroy function has the same syntax and valid fields as the build function.
      Example: ./net -cd Year
    
    -u Unload the current file being used

      Unloads the current file so a new one can be loaded in.
      Example: ./net -cu
